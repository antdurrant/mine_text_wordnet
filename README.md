The goal of mine_text_wordnet is to allow you to upload English word/pdf files or type directly, and get automatically produced wordlists for the language of your choice.

Currently, this only works locally if you have R and Python with NLTK and wordnet installed and downloaded.

One day soon, I'll figure out how to put that in a dockerfile and get it hosted.

It is also currently horrendously slow, I think I have the reactives working poorly.
